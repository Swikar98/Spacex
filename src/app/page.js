        The ETHOS Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion was developed
        as a means of improving the understanding and measurement of
        homelessness in Europe, and to provide a common "language" for
        transnational exchanges on homelessness. The ETHOS approach says
        homelessness is a process (rather than a static phenomenon) that affects
        many vulnerable households at different points in their lives.[14] The
        typology was launched in 2005 and is used for different purposes: as a
        framework for debate,[15] for data collection purposes, policy purposes,
        monitoring purposes, and in the media. This typology is an open exercise
        that makes abstraction of existing legal definitions in the EU member
        states. It exists in 25 language versions, the translations being
        provided mainly by volunteer translators. Many countries and individuals
        do not consider housing as a human right. Former U.S. President Jimmy
        Carter addressed this issue in a 2017 interview, saying, "A lot of
        people don't look at housing as a human right, but it is." His view
        contrasts with many Americans who do not believe housing is a basic
        human right.[16]The ETHOS Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion
